## About the tutorial

This hands-on tutorial introduces [Oceananigans.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl) — a Julia package for fast, GPU-friendly fluid simulations — through a series of self-contained geophysical and atmospheric flow examples. The aim is to show how modern programming tools can bridge the gap between ease of use and the extreme performance required for high-resolution fluid simulations.

## This repository

Each subdirectory is a self-contained example that can be run interactively in a Julia REPL or executed as a script. Together they showcase a range of Oceananigans (and Breeze) capabilities: nonhydrostatic flow, immersed boundaries, stratified shear instabilities, turbulence closures, and moist atmospheric dynamics.

| Directory | Description |
|---|---|
| `dry_atmosphere_les/` | Doubly-periodic 3D atmosphere simulation driven by a pressure-gradient body force and quadratic surface drag, with a passive tracer |
| `hill_flow/` | 2D nonhydrostatic flow past a Gaussian hill using the immersed boundary method |
| `kelvin_helmholtz/` | 2D Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a stratified shear layer |
| `free_convection/` | 3D atmospheric free convection heated from below with dynamic Smagorinsky closure |
| `rain_over_ocean/` | 2D precipitating shallow cumulus convection (RICO case) using Breeze's anelastic model with one-moment cloud microphysics |

Each directory contains a simulation script (e.g. `hill_flow.jl`) and a matching plot script (e.g. `plot_hill_flow.jl`). Run the simulation first to produce the output file, then run the plot script to generate the animation.

## Prerequisites

- [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) (1.12 or later recommended)
- All dependencies are listed in `Project.toml`. Install them in one step:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.instantiate()
```

This will install [Oceananigans.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl), [Breeze.jl](https://github.com/NumericalEarth/Breeze.jl), [GLMakie.jl](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl), [Oceanostics.jl](https://github.com/tomchor/Oceanostics.jl), and other dependencies automatically.

## Running the examples

Each script can be run from the Julia REPL (recommended for interactive exploration) or from the terminal:

```bash
julia kelvin_helmholtz/kelvin_helmholtz.jl   # run simulation
julia kelvin_helmholtz/plot_kelvin_helmholtz.jl  # produce animation
```

Because the scripts avoid module-level constants, you can freely modify parameters and re-`include` them in the same REPL session without restarting Julia.
