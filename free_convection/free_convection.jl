# =============================================================================
# Atmospheric free convection
#
# A weakly stratified atmosphere heated from below. No mean pressure gradient
# — flow is driven purely by buoyancy (free convection).
# Quadratic bulk drag at the surface.
#
# Temperature (potential temperature θ) is the active tracer, coupled to
# buoyancy via SeawaterBuoyancy with an ideal-gas linear EOS (β = 0).
